<p>I have something exciting to share—the first edition of <em>an ode to</em> is finally complete! It is a collection of seven essays, each about something that has made an impact on my life. I&rsquo;ve posted two of these already—the ones about Monster Energy and the conversation pit—but the other five are completely new.</p>

<p>You can read the first edition <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Cy5taU9pndJtt5r-K9nHHp6Qs7vLTnYVRv9hIX1qvrM/edit?usp=sharing">here</a>. Also, if you know me personally and want a physical copy, let me know and I will make one for you.</p>

<p>Hope you enjoy!</p>
