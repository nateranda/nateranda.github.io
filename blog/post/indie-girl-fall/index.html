<p><em>Don your cardigan and get cozy.</em></p>

<p>At the release of Charli XCX&rsquo;s <em>Brat</em> last June, it was clear that this summer would be for the party girls. The album was a celebration of the glitzy modern club scene, full of punchy basslines, bubbly synths, and vocals dripping with autotune. &ldquo;I Love It&rdquo;-era veterans and new listeners alike praised Charli&rsquo;s songwriting, infectious hooks, and introspective lyrics, with some even calling it the &lsquo;album of the summer.&rsquo; And they were mostly right: <em>Brat</em> sits at #2 on Rate Your Music&rsquo;s yearly chart, and the Harris campaign rebranded itself around the new album, making waves on social media.</p>

<p>But as the hot, sticky part of the year is finally subsiding and a fresh chill is making its way through the Northern Hemisphere, it&rsquo;s time for <em>Brat</em> to step aside and let some other albums have the spotlight. And other albums there are! The indie sphere has seen some real heavy hitters recently, so much so that the next couple months should be reserved for the Porta Pro-wearing, vinyl-spinning, cottage-core indie girlies.</p>

<p>The release making the biggest waves recently is synth-pop duo Magdalena Bay&rsquo;s album <em>Imaginal Disk</em>. The full-length LP is nearly an hour of brilliant songwriting and dynamic soundscapes, topped off with Mica Tenenbaum&rsquo;s captivating and expressive vocals. Cuts like &ldquo;Killing Time&rdquo; and &ldquo;That&rsquo;s My Floor&rdquo; bring an infectious energy to the album with distorted guitars and booming basslines, while other songs like &ldquo;Watching T.V.&rdquo; and &ldquo;Angel on a Satellite&rdquo; pull back the noise and reveal the duo&rsquo;s delicate and ethereal side. While <em>Mercurial World</em> showed listeners what the band was capable of, <em>Imaginal Disk</em> took the sound to new heights. No &lsquo;sophomore slump&rsquo; for Matt and Mica, only heaters.</p>

<p>Another eagerly awaited album was Clario&rsquo;s <em>Charm</em>, releasing in July of this year. The album marks a considerable shift from the Massachusetts native&rsquo;s roots as a bedroom pop artist. It brings a jazzy, vintage feel, full of glitzy pianos, warm basslines, smooth drums, and Claire&rsquo;s soft vocals. She hits her stride in the second half of the album—the jazz ballad &ldquo;Juna&rdquo; plays into a beautiful motif captured by warbly synths and brass instruments. &ldquo;Echo&rdquo; is a playful nod to the unorthodox alt-rock sound captured by bands like Stereolab, Sweet Trip, and 800 Cherries. &ldquo;Glory of the Snow&rdquo; is almost begging to be sampled, with a hook that would fit perfectly into a Zelooperz track. The album sits right in the pocket for its entire runtime—a vibe all the way through. If you need an album to unwind to, <em>Charm</em> is the perfect fit.</p>

<p>July also saw the release of Remi Wolf&rsquo;s <em>Big Ideas</em>, a maximalist and playful take on the bedroom pop genre. Coming off her first full-length EP <em>Juno</em>, Remi brings a more mature, but still playful mood to the album, churning out tracks that are elevated in their songwriting while still feeling fresh and unique. On <em>Big Ideas</em>, Remi shows she is unmatched in her hooks—songs like &ldquo;Frog Rock&rdquo; and &ldquo;Toro&rdquo; weasel into your head with their full-sounding, layered vocals and punchy grooves. But unlike <em>Juno</em>, which stays firmly in the pop bubble, <em>Big Ideas</em> visits other genres. &ldquo;Motorcycle&rdquo; slows down the groove and pares back the layers to put Remi&rsquo;s voice at the forefront, and &ldquo;Just the Start&rdquo; is nothing but her voice and an acoustic guitar. It&rsquo;s clear that Remi is more confident in her songwriting abilities, and this confidence is what makes the album shine.</p>

<p>And that&rsquo;s not even the end of it! Still Woozy&rsquo;s <em>Loveseat</em> is a continuation of the smooth, catchy, groovy pop tracks he&rsquo;s known for. Parannoul&rsquo;s <em>Sky Hundred</em> is a grungy, lo-fi spin on modern shoegaze. Dance music has also had some exciting releases, with Floating Points, Skee Mask, Salute, and Jamie XX all dropping new albums. 2024 has been a rather impressive year for music, so why not celebrate it? Order your pumpkin spice latte, put on your oversized sweater, and live your best indie girl fall.</p>
