![an ode to zine](/projects/an-ode-to/book.jpg)

*an ode to* is a zine of seven essays, each about something that has made an impact on my life. You can read the first edition [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Cy5taU9pndJtt5r-K9nHHp6Qs7vLTnYVRv9hIX1qvrM/edit?usp=sharing). Also, if you know me personally and want a physical copy, let me know and I will make one for you.

Hope you enjoy!
