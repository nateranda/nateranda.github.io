    <h3>Our Client</h3>
    <p>We made this infographic for the WPI Green Team and their Project Zero Waste, an initiative that aims to reduce the food waste produced on campus and advocates for food waste solutions. They wanted an infographic that was eye-catching to students and urged readers to be more conscious of their own food waste in Morgan Dining Hall. The Green Team supplied the class with a graph of food wasted per person in Morgan, which we based our statistics off of.</p>
    <h3>Inspiration</h3>
    <p>We wanted our infographic to be informative without being overloaded with information, as students are more likely to read a simple infographic than a wall of text during their busy class rush. This stems from Edward Tufte’s “Statistical and Visual Thinking”, which explored the role of simplicity and elegance in data presentation. Tufte argued that the Cholera outbreak of 1854 in London was taken so seriously because it was presented by John Snow in a concise, simple way and efficiently highlighted the link between the outbreak and the water pumps that he believed spread the disease (Tufte, 27). In our design, we wanted to incorporate this idea of simplicity, as a page overloaded with information could cloud its rhetorical efficiency (Tufte, 41).</p>
    <p>Through the rhetorical choices made informed by our texts, We aimed to make a simplistic design that was also attention grabbing and had a large impact. Through the use of a calculated statistic we felt would be the most moving—the amount of people that could be fed from the waste created—we were able to keep the “minimalistic” style that Tufte refers to and keep our design efficient (Tufte, 41).</p>
    <p>With our main goal in mind of satisfying the client's request for spreading information on the Project Zero Waste initiative, we also wanted to do it ethically and with clarity. We were inspired by Sam Dragga and Dan Voss’ “Cruel Pies: The Inhumanity of Technical Illustrations”, which points out the dehumanizing aspects of technical illustrations and suggests ethical solutions to the problem. A key concept that we focused on was that of ethical visual presentation which we used to inform the way our ideas were conveyed (Dragga, 2). As we are dealing with a potentially sensitive topic of food waste, we went the route of semantic fusion in a sense, instead of relying heavily on potentially upsetting or unethical visual representations (Dragga, 7).</p>
    <p>In addition to the concepts from Dragga and Voss, we also took inspiration from “Pictures, Symbols, and Signs” by Rudolf Arnheim, which explores the relationship between pictures, symbols, and signs and stresses the importance of visuals in communication. In particular, we wanted to utilize pictures to ensure that what we were trying to represent was clear and not left up to interpretation (Arnheim, 139). It is not easy to replicate even the most literal ideas, as readers are able to interpret things in various ways, so we wanted to choose something that would be represented extremely literally (Arnheim, 139). We wanted our pictures to be supplementing the words, not the other way around.</p>
    <h3>Design Evolution</h3>
    <p>Our design started out as a crude sketch of the main ideas we wanted to convey:</p>
    <img class="half-crop" src="/static/images/2.3-reflection/infographic-prototype-1.jpg"/>
    <em class="caption">A sketched prototype of our design</em>
    <p>This sketch had some of the elements of our final design, but its illustrations were crude and a call-to-action was completely missing. We knew we were on the right track, but our ideas had to be fleshed out to create an appealing final product.</p>
    <p>Our second design iterated considerably on the first, but we hit a roadblock: We had to choose between including a visual representation of the people who could be fed or not. We ended up making two separate designs, one with and one without:</p>
    <img class="half-crop" src="/static/images/2.3-reflection/infographic-prototype-2.png"/>
    <img class="half-crop" src="/static/images/2.3-reflection/infographic-prototype-3.png"/>
    <em class="caption">Our two revisions, with and without the extra visual.</em>
    <p>The sketches were replaced with high-res images, our statistics were finalized, and a call-to-action was placed at the bottom. However, during our peer review we got numerous ideas for improvements, and they preferred the design without the visual representation better than the one with. We incorporated this feedback in our final design, changing the green to be less bright, as the original green taken from the Green Team logo was too neon to be seen clearly. We also shifted the emphasis on the words to be clearer, made the text bigger as a whole, and included more citations. Finally, we changed the steak dinner to a salad to protect against accidentally blaming the food waste problem on meat consumption.</p>
    <p>We’re proud of the final design we settled on, and we hope that these rhetorical choices resulted in an infographic that was eye-catching to students and efficient in its delivery.</p>
