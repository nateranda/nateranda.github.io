    <p>We created this comic to raise awareness among students on campus about the rising issue of food waste. We aimed to do this by creating an engaging, creative, and informative design that will cause students to stop and rethink their choices in the dining hall. In addition to giving strategies to help individuals reduce their own food waste, our comic also urges students to advocate for compost bins on campus. We aim to successfully meet the needs of our client, the Waste Management subcommittee of the Green Team, and, most importantly, effectively shine a light on a serious issue that is not only at WPI but in the world.</p>
    <p>In designing this comic, we aimed to be entertaining and engaging while still being informative and compelling. Tim McCloud outlines some strategies to do this in “Show and Tell,” like using different picture-word combinations (ie. word-forward panels, picture-forward panels, or a combination of the two) and letting pictures and words each have their time in the spotlight (McCloud, 153 & 156). We tried to include both of these strategies. Our comic also contains some comedy to ensure that key points stand out. With a mix of personal experience, research, and the information provided to us through the Green Team, we hope our design can be used to promote their message and initiative around campus. Through the comic creation site Pixton, we aim to touch on all of these things while keeping our comic visually appealing and easy to read and follow.</p>
    <p>We decided to combine a traditional story with talking straight to the audience. Both of these techniques would effectively convey a message, but we thought that a combination of them would be more impactful to the reader. We varied panel sizes and combined words and pictures in most panels to give focus on certain key points we thought were important. The more text-heavy panels are filled with the most information for the reader while the image-based panels convey information in a creative and eye-catching way. Once the attention of the reader is grabbed through the story-like opening to our comic, we hope that by the end of it they are well informed as well as possess the urge to advocate for the installation of compost bins around the campus.</p>
