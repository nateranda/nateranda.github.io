    <p>This is the final design of our comic. You can download it <a href="/static/files/3.3-reflection/nate-asha-comic-final.pdf">here</a>.</p>
    <h3>Our Client</h3>
    <p>Like the last project, our client is the WPI Green Team. They want a comic that effectively spreads awareness about the benefits of composting and urges people to advocate for composting on campus. While we do touch on the benefits of composting slightly, we decided to focus more on composting awareness and advocacy, specifically in Morgan Dining Hall.</p>
    <h3>Inspiration</h3>
    <p>Our comic starts with a relatable scenario that many on-campus residents encounter at Morgan: having to throw away perfectly good food because you’re full or because it didn’t meet your expectations. This is used as a ‘hook’ to show Morgan diners that their experiences are shared by others. Scott McCloud employs this technique frequently in his comic “Google on Google Chrome” to keep readers engaged. For example, he lightens up the more tech-heavy sections with scenes depicting common browser annoyances, like the browser staying slow even after other tabs are closed, to show how the Google team has fixed them (Google  6). He even uses some comedic relief to give readers even more of a break from information-dense panels (Google 6). We aimed to capture readers’ attention in a similar way throughout the comic, using the hook described above and adding in some more comedic panels to act as a reprieve from the more information-dense sections.</p>
    <p>We also use a variety of picture-specific and word-specific panels to break up the monotony of the information and help readers acquire a conceptual understanding of the more abstract information presented. McCloud covers this in his comic “Show and Tell”, where he outlines the different layouts of panels and how they are used most effectively to convey meaning. McCloud states that comics are most effective when words and pictures each have their time in the spotlight but don’t overcrowd each other (McCloud 156). We aimed to preserve this ‘dance’ between pictures and words by interjecting dialogue with scene changes, props, and drawings that visualize the concepts that are being discussed.</p>
    <h3>Method</h3>
    <p>Our comic was made using two technologies: Pixton and Canva. Pixton is an all-in-one comic-creation suite, letting users pose custom characters in scenes with background, props, and dialogue. However, Pixton’s canvas is limited to a 1:1 square and doesn’t contain any informational graphics, so we used Canva to arrange the panels in a more interesting layout and augmented the panels with Creative Commons graphics and our own hand-drawn assets.</p>
    <p>These technologies helped us satisfy the client's request for a creative, eye-catching, and color-appealing design. We were intentional in choosing from the wide selection of graphics from both Pixton and Canva ensuring that they were eye-catching but also relevant and conveyed some form of meaning. The creative freedom of these technologies allowed us to utilize all the techniques mentioned by McCloud to ensure that we were effectively conveying our story and message and not just putting pictures and words on a page (McCloud 152).</p>
    <h3>Design Evolution</h3>
    <p>We started off with a hand-drawn storyboard design. We ensured that all of our key ideas were presented, whether it was through dialogue or images.</p>
    <img class="half-crop" src="/static/images/3.3-reflection/storyboard.png" alt="Our Storyboard">
    <em class="caption">Our initial storyboard.</em>
    <p>We translated that sketch into our digital format and created our first draft. As our sketch came to life we made choices to omit/rephrase certain things but we created a polished first draft that we were proud of. However, we still had a few suggestions for improvement from peer review that we incorporated. In this first draft, we had a few slides that were word-specific and did not have any backgrounds which people seemed to find a bit off-putting and also made an error in duplicating a panel.</p>

    <em class="caption">The first digital draft of our comic.</em>
    <p>We took those suggestions and implemented them in our second draft. We removed the white backgrounds that we had and ensured that all of our panels had a setting/background. Some of these included a chalkboard with illustrations in them that relate to the dialogue to create more of an inter-dependent style than just word-specific. We removed that duplicate panel and added in a new one and once again we were happy with the design we created. We also decided to add the Green Team’s logo to our comic which we felt was an important touch.</p>

    <em class="caption">The second digital draft of our comic.</em>
    <p>However, in the final iteration of our comic design, we wanted to make one final tweak in our dialogue. This choice was made to ensure that if Green Team were to utilize our design they wouldn't be putting their name on something that may come off as critical of WPI. Though our aim was to be comedic, we did not want to promote any negativity in our design so we made some changes to our opening dialogue to still fit the rest of our design while being a bit more positive!</p>
    
    <p>All in all, we are proud of our design and we hope the choices that we decided on display our message and promote the Green Team’s initiative effectively and creatively.</p>
