    <p>Our design is called Overgrowth.</p>
    <p><img src="/static/images/1.3-reflection/font-preview.png"/></p>
    <p>This font was designed for WPI’s Society of Medieval Arts and Sciences (SMAS), a roleplaying group that holds medieval-themed events and exhibitions on campus. They needed a font that looked medieval but strayed from the traditional etched-in-stone scripted style, commonly used to depict this period. They would use this font for social media posts and promotional flyers, which meant that it had to be legible and eye-catching from any distance.</p>
    <p>We both agreed that we wanted our design to be one cohesive design that wasn’t too heavy on illustration, with each letter sharing the same design elements. We prioritized recognizable letterforms that fit the client’s requests while still staying readable. At first, we settled on the idea of “crystallized mana”. We added crystal growths, sparkles, and highlights to each letter, trying to make the font look as if it was shimmering in the light. While this idea landed up close, it lost its meaning farther away, compounded by the fact that some of the finer detail was lost when the individual letters were converted to a font on Calligraphr. We didn’t have any ideas on how to improve this design, and as a result, we decided to pivot entirely.</p>
    <p>We kept the letterforms of our first design, but instead detailed each letter to look like it was being enveloped by thorny, leafy vines. These vines split and join back together, wrap around each letter’s body, and even leap across gaps and holes. Despite the intricacy up close, the small stroke of the vines didn’t overpower the letter. As the letters get smaller (or farther away) the entangled vines gradually resemble cracks, a byproduct that was not intended but helps give the letters a more 'weathered' look. Although this was not in the original list of inspirations provided by the client, we believe that the imagery certainly invokes feelings of medieval times and castles/structures, and hope that the client likes it regardless.</p>
    <p>We originally thought to vectorize the font to make it look more cohesive and standardized; however, we decided that the casual look of the digitally hand-drawn letters would add to the charm and character of the font, so we stuck with original e-ink design. Some of the inconsistencies help the font look more medieval, like each letter has faced some wear and tear but still held the test of time. And since this font will be used in a much more informal setting, being printed on posters and flyers, the hand-drawn letters and slight inconsistencies make the font look less cold and more inviting.</p>
    <p>The main challenge we faced was reconciling our broad and vast and big ideas with what we could realistically achieve for this font. We came up with plenty of conceptual and visual ideas in the beginning and were struggling to decide which one to pursue, so at one point, we just had to choose an idea and stick to it. </p>
